# toDoList App

Winc Academy's 3rd project of the Front-end Development traineeship

## 💬 Project Goal

The goal is to create a to-do list web app. The app uses API(1) and user data to dynamically update the UI.
After every interaction with the web-page the app updates the task list. The “add task” button lets the user add a task to the list. It is possible to check the items from the list or remove them. All tasks can be cleared from the list when pressing the "clear all" button.

## 💬 Tools

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API(1)

* GET-request: retrieve the current task-list from the database 
* Add a new task entered in the text area, when click on "add task" button 
* POST-request: update the task-list with a new task (entered in the search bar)
* DELETE-request: delete one task from the task-list (when delete icon is pressed)
