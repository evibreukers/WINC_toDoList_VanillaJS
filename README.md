# toDoList App

Winc Academy's 3rd project of the Front-end Development traineeship

## 💬 Project Goal

The goal is making a to-do-list app using JavaScript and a database (via a RESTful API (1)).
The app is a single webpage containing a task-list and a text area to add new custom tasks. The “add task” button lets the user add a task to the list. It is possible to check the items from the list or remove them. All tasks can be cleared from the list when pressing the "clear all" button.
